# NUCLEO-G031K8 Nucleo-32 board

## Overview

The STM32 Nucleo-32 board provides an affordable and flexible way for users to try out new concepts and build
prototypes by choosing from the various combinations of performance and power consumption features, provided by the
STM32 microcontroller.

The Arduino™ Nano V3 connectivity support allows the easy expansion of the functionality of the STM32 Nucleo open
development platform with a wide choice of specialized shields.

The STM32 Nucleo-32 board does not require any separate probe as it integrates the ST-LINK debugger/programmer.
